# GenerateCodes
Randomly generates codes between 0000 and 9999, this is my first Android app, I did it to learn and ... solve the problem below :-)

### Imagine
You have bought a nice car from Nissan. You ride and ride, then you need to change a lamp.
Well, as you want to make it properly, you open a car instruction.
There stays : 1st) starts with detach battery sign (-).

If you have done it you would face blocked radio. 
You need a 4 digit code to unlock it.
Apparently, you (and other happy Nissan users - I have found at the web) was not given the code by your local car diler.
Supprise?

So, now you **understand** - why I wrote the app. Its generates code between 0000 and 9999 randomly (unifromly distributed),
but never repetes. 

Comparing to other Google Play apps, it **keeps tracs** even **after turned off** (not reinstalled - but this is done by purpouse).
It **allows to skip** some **codes** when **already tested** (for example by your girlfriend).
